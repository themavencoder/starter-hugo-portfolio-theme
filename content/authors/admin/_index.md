Guangying Ma is a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at [University of Illinois Chicago](https://uic.edu/). I joined the [Biomedical Optics and Ophthalmic Imaging Laboratory](https://yaolab.bioe.uic.edu/) in 2019 under the supervision of [Dr. Xincheng Yao](https://yaolab.bioe.uic.edu/dr-yao/). 

H﻿e is  currently studying the functional imaging of the retina. 

His research includes optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging system reconstruction, image processing and biomedical data analysis.

H﻿e is  currently investigating the different technqiues involved in optical system reconstruction and medical image signal analysis in the mouse and human retina.
